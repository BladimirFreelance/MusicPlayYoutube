This is a Windows program project that plays broadcasts from the YouTube platform in the background mode. As the project develops, more features and code will be added to it. The pilot version contains only one playback address; the program itself remains minimized in the system tray without any controls. By right-clicking on the icon, you can access the menu for exiting and ending the program. To add your icon in the main.py code, you need to change the line self.tray_icon.setIcon(QtGui.QIcon(resource_path("YourIcon.png"))). The file with your icon should be located in the same directory as the main.py file. And change the line youtube_live_url = "https://www.youtube.com/live/Your URL Yotube Live Music" to play your broadcast. It is also important to install all dependencies before compilation; an important dependency is pip install yt-dlp, which needs to be executed in the terminal. To compile into an executable file, use pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data "YourIcon.png;." main.py, and also install the VLC Media Player from the official website on your computer.
